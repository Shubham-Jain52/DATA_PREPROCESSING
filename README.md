# DATA_PREPROCESSING

## **Personal Notes on Data Preprocessing with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib**

This repository contains my personal notes on data preprocessing using Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The notebook captures essential techniques for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data, which are key steps in any data science project.

### Topics covered include:

- **Importing datasets and getting basic insights**
- **how to deal with missing values in a dataset**
- **Dealing with data using sci-kit learn**
- **Data formating and data binning** 

The notebook provides clear explanations and practical code examples, designed to make these concepts accessible to both beginners and intermediate learners. It serves as a helpful reference for anyone looking to improve their data preprocessing skills.

I hope this resource helps you gain a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and visualize data effectively. Feel free to explore the notebook, experiment with the code, and apply these techniques to your own projects. Itâ€™s a great starting point for anyone interested in data science or machine learning.
